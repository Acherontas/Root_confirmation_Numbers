# Root_confirmation_Numbers
Confirmation of the correct result of a square number

you will be asked for a number and the result of the square 
as long as the square result is close to the math.h header file result set
the result set even through the last two divisions 
contains a weird range of numbers
the result should almost be identical 
from integer part and at some part from the decimal float part
